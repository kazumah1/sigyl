## üéØ Next Priority Tasks

### 1. Implement 3D Chess Game (HIGH PRIORITY)
```typescript
// Required: Install Three.js dependencies
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei

// Create components:
- ChessBoard3D.tsx
- ChessPiece3D.tsx  
- ChessGame.tsx
- ChessAI.tsx (basic AI opponent)
```

### 2. Enhance Chess Piece Theme Integration
```typescript
// Features needed:
- Theme-aware chess piece colors
- Page-specific piece types
- Advanced 3D rendering with theme colors
- Particle effects matching theme
```

### 3. Backend Implementation
```typescript
// Supabase setup required:
- Authentication tables
- MCP server configurations
- Marketplace item database
- User profiles and permissions
```

## üìã Technical Implementation Guide

### Installing Three.js for 3D Chess
```bash
npm install three@latest
npm install @react-three/fiber@^8.18.0
npm install @react-three/drei@^9.122.0
npm install @types/three
```

### 3D Chess Game Structure
```typescript
// src/components/chess/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChessBoard3D.tsx      // Main 3D chess board with theme integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChessPiece3D.tsx      // Individual piece component with theme colors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChessGame.tsx         // Game logic and state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChessAI.tsx           // AI opponent logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChessControls.tsx     // Camera and interaction controls
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ChessUtils.ts         // Chess game utilities
```

### Theme Integration for Chess Pieces
```typescript
// Theme-aware chess piece colors:
const themeColors = {
  vibrant: { primary: '#6366F1', secondary: '#EC4899', accent: '#10B981' },
  sunset: { primary: '#F59E0B', secondary: '#EF4444', accent: '#8B5CF6' },
  ocean: { primary: '#0EA5E9', secondary: '#06B6D4', accent: '#3B82F6' },
  forest: { primary: '#10B981', secondary: '#059669', accent: '#34D399' }
};
```

### Backend Structure (Supabase)
```sql
-- Required database tables:
- users (authentication)
- mcp_servers (deployed servers)
- marketplace_items (tools and templates)
- deployments (deployment history)
- user_favorites (saved items)
```

## üîß Development Notes

### Current Issues to Fix
1. **Three.js Integration**: Need to properly set up 3D rendering pipeline for chess game
2. **Performance**: Optimize animations for mobile devices

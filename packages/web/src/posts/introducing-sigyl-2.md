# Introducing SIGYL 2.0: The Future of MCP Deployment

Today we're excited to announce **SIGYL 2.0**, a major milestone in our journey to make Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment accessible, secure, and powerful for developers worldwide.

## What's New in SIGYL 2.0

### Enhanced Security Framework

Security has always been at the core of our platform, and SIGYL 2.0 takes it to the next level:

- **Advanced Secret Management**: Our new secrets manager provides enterprise-grade encryption and secure injection into MCP deployments
- **OAuth Integration**: Seamless GitHub App integration with proper consent handling
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all deployment and access activities

### Improved Developer Experience

We've completely redesigned the developer experience based on feedback from our community:

```typescript
// Example: Deploying an MCP server with SIGYL 2.0
const deployment = await sigyl.deploy({
  repository: "github.com/user/my-mcp-server",
  secrets: {
    OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-...",
    DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://..."
  },
  environment: "production"
});
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **50% faster deployment times** through optimized container building
- **Real-time health monitoring** with automatic failover
- **Intelligent caching** for frequently accessed MCP servers

## Getting Started with SIGYL 2.0

### 1. Update Your CLI

```bash
npm install -g @sigyl/cli@latest
```

### 2. Authenticate with GitHub

```bash
sigyl auth github
```

### 3. Deploy Your First MCP

```bash
sigyl deploy github.com/your-username/your-mcp-server
```

## What's Coming Next

We're already working on SIGYL 2.1, which will include:

- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user workspaces with role-based access
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed usage metrics and performance insights
- **Custom Domains**: Deploy MCP servers to your own domains
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications for deployment events

## Join Our Community

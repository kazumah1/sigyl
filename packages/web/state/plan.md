## [Latest Updates] Rate Limiting Fix & UI Color Fixes ✅

### [Feature] Full-Stack Profile & Settings Management
- **Summary**: Implemented full-stack functionality for the `/settings` page, including profile updates and a secure account deletion process.
- **Profile Tab**:
    - Users can now update their "Display Name".
    - The frontend calls the `PUT /api/v1/profiles/me` endpoint to save changes.
- **Settings Tab**:
    - The "Delete Account" feature has been enabled.
    - It uses a two-step confirmation process to prevent accidental deletion.
- **Backend**:
    - The `DELETE /api/v1/profiles/me` endpoint was enhanced to be more robust.
    - It now uses a Supabase admin client to delete the user from `auth.users`, ensuring their session is terminated and they are fully removed from the system, in addition to deleting their profile data.
- **Result**: The settings page is now fully functional, providing users with essential account management capabilities.

### [Fix] Duplicate API Path Issue
- **Problem**: API calls were failing with 404 errors in the production environment due to a duplicated `/api/v1` in the request URL (e.g., `/api/v1/api/v1/profiles/me`).
- **Root Cause**: The `VITE_REGISTRY_API_URL` in production already contained `/api/v1`, but the frontend code was unconditionally appending another `/api/v1`, causing a malformed URL. The local environment was unaffected as it used a default URL without the path.
- **Locations**:
    - `packages/web/src/services/profilesService.ts`
    - `packages/web/src/services/mcpServerService.ts`
    - `packages/web/src/services/analyticsService.ts`
- **Solution**: The `apiCall` helper function in the affected services was updated to be more intelligent. It now checks if the base URL already ends with `/api/v1` and only appends it if necessary.
- **Result**: API URLs are now constructed correctly in both local and production environments, resolving the 404 errors.

### 4. **Button Color UI Fixes** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Multiple button color issues in popups
  - API key popup close button: white text on white background (unreadable)
  - Copy buttons: turning purple on hover instead of white
  - Environment variable "Create" button: turning purple on hover instead of white
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent button styling classes and color overrides
- **Locations**: 
  - `packages/web/src/components/dashboard/APIKeysManager.tsx`
  - `packages/web/src/components/dashboard/SecretsManager.tsx`
- **Solution**: Updated button classes to use proper color schemes:
  - Close buttons: `text-black bg-white hover:bg-gray-100` (black text on white background)
  - Copy buttons: `bg-black border border-white text-white hover:bg-white hover:text-black`
  - Create buttons: `bg-black border border-white text-white hover:bg-white hover:text-black`
- **Result**: All buttons now have proper contrast and turn white on hover instead of purple

### 3. **Rate Limiting 429 Errors Fixed** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Dashboard API calls failing with `429 (Too Many Requests)` errors
- **Root Cause**: Rate limiting was too restrictive for development (100 requests/15min)
- **Location**: `packages/registry-api/src/middleware/security.ts`
- **Solution**: Increased rate limits for development:
  - General: 100 → **1000 requests/15min**
  - Auth: 100 → **500 requests/15min** 
  - Deployment: 20 → **100 requests/hour**
- **Result**: Secrets tab and all dashboard functionality now works without rate limit errors

### 1. **GitHub App Deploy Flow Fixed** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Deploy page showed infinite loading spinner instead of GitHub App installation prompt
- **Root Cause**: Component's loading state remained `true` when `installationId` was `null` (no installation)
- **Location**: `packages/web/src/components/DeployWizardWithGitHubApp.tsx`
- **Solution**: Modified `useEffect` to set `loading: false` when `installationId === null`
- **Result**: Deploy flow now correctly shows "Install GitHub App" prompt when no installation exists

### 2. **Purple Button Hover Colors Fixed** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
- **Problem**: Various buttons had purple hover colors instead of white
- **Root Cause**: CSS primary color variables were set to blue-purple HSL values
- **Locations Fixed**:
  - `packages/web/src/index.css` - Changed `--primary` from purple to white (`0 0% 100%`)
  - `packages/web/src/components/dashboard/MCPServersList.tsx` - Changed purple hover to white hover
  - `packages/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Changed purple/indigo backgrounds and text to white
- **Result**: All buttons now have consistent white hover colors

## [Update] Dashboard MCP Server List

- The dashboard MCP server list now queries the `mcp_packages` table, filtering by `author_id` (which is the user's profile UUID, looked up by their `github_id`).
- This replaces the old logic that listed servers by workspace.
- This ensures that users only see their own deployed MCP servers/packages on the dashboard. 

# **AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM FULLY RESTORED** ✅

## **Issues Resolved** ✅

### 1. **Dashboard Auto-Redirect Issue** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: Dashboard automatically redirected users to GitHub App installation page
- **Location**: `packages/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` lines 58-77
- **Solution**: Commented out the automatic GitHub App installation check
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Dashboard accessible without redirects

### 2. **AuthContext Auto-Redirect Issue** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: AuthContext automatically redirected after login
- **Location**: `packages/web/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` lines 810-825
- **Solution**: Commented out the automatic GitHub App installation check
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

### 3. **Login Auto-Redirect Issue** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: Login page automatically redirected after sign-in
- **Location**: `packages/web/src/pages/Login.tsx` lines 108-135
- **Solution**: Commented out the automatic GitHub App installation check
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

### 4. **API Authentication Failures** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: 401 Unauthorized errors for `/api/v1/secrets` and `/api/v1/keys`
- **Root Cause**: Frontend sending invalid placeholder token `db_restored_token`
- **Solution**: Fixed token selection logic to use valid Supabase JWT token
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Both endpoints now working

## **Solutions Implemented** 🔧

### 1. **Fixed Frontend Token Selection** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Location**: `packages/web/src/components/dashboard/SecretsManager.tsx`
- **Problem**: Frontend was prioritizing invalid placeholder token over valid Supabase JWT
- **Solution**: Enhanced token validation logic:
  1. **GitHub App Token**: Must be real token (not placeholder) with correct prefix
  2. **Supabase JWT**: Must be valid JWT format (3 parts separated by dots)
  3. **Fallback**: Clear error message if no valid token found
- **Result**: Now correctly uses valid Supabase JWT token

### 2. **Hybrid Authentication Middleware** ✅ **WORKING**
- **Location**: `packages/registry-api/src/middleware/auth.ts`
- **Function**: `authenticateHybrid()` and `requireHybridAuth`
- **Capability**: Handles both GitHub App tokens AND Supabase JWT tokens
- **Status**: Successfully validating Supabase JWT tokens

### 3. **Updated API Routes** ✅ **WORKING**
- **API Keys Route**: `packages/registry-api/src/routes/apiKeys.ts`
- **Secrets Route**: `packages/registry-api/src/routes/secrets.ts`
- **Change**: Using `requireHybridAuth` middleware
- **Result**: Both routes now successfully authenticate with Supabase JWT tokens

## **Current Status** 🎯

### ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- Dashboard loads without unwanted redirects ✅
- Secrets tab loads successfully (shows empty list, ready for secrets) ✅
- API Keys tab loads successfully (shows empty list, ready for keys) ✅
- Authentication working seamlessly with Supabase JWT tokens ✅
- Hybrid authentication system supporting both GitHub App and Supabase users ✅

### 🎉 **AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM RESTORED**
The authentication system is now **100% functional**:

# **MAJOR ARCHITECTURE MIGRATION: SUPABASE → BACKEND API** 🚀

## **Migration Overview** ✅ **COMPLETED**

### **Problem**
- Frontend was making direct Supabase calls from services and components
- This created security concerns and made the architecture less maintainable
- Direct database access from frontend violates best practices

### **Solution** 
- Migrated all Supabase calls to go through our backend API
- Created new API routes to handle all database operations
- Updated frontend services to use HTTP API calls instead of direct database queries

The architecture is now **properly decoupled, secure, and scalable**! 🚀

# Plan Update: Settings/Profile Page Implementation

## Summary
- Implemented a new settings page at `/settings` with a sidebar navigation for 'Profile' and 'Settings'.
- Sidebar allows switching between profile and settings views in a single page layout.
- Added a `/profile` route that deep-links to the profile tab of the settings page.
- Updated the user dropdown menu (top right) to navigate to `/profile` and `/settings` for the respective buttons.
- Removed the non-functional GitHub button from the dropdown for now.

## Details
- Created `SettingsPage.tsx` with sidebar and main content area, using state to switch between tabs.
- Created `ProfilePage.tsx` which redirects to `/settings` with the profile tab active (deep-link).
- Updated `App.tsx` to add protected routes for `/settings` and `/profile`.
- Updated `UserProfile.tsx` dropdown to use `useNavigate` for navigation.
- Sidebar and layout are inspired by the dashboard but simplified for user settings.

## Next Steps
- Implement actual profile editing and settings functionality.
- Optionally, re-add GitHub integration button with working logic.

## [Security Update] Secrets API: No Plaintext Values in GET/List

### Problem
- Secrets API was returning plaintext secret values in GET/list responses, which is a security risk.

### Solution
- **Backend**: GET /api/v1/secrets and GET /api/v1/secrets/:id no longer return the value field. Only POST/PUT return value (to creator/updater).
- **Frontend**: Updated to never expect value in GET/list. UI no longer shows/copies secret values in the list.
- **Types**: Secret.value is now optional, only present on create/update.

### Result
- No plaintext secret values are ever exposed in list or get-by-id API responses.
- Only the user who creates/updates a secret sees the value, and only at that moment.
- Follows industry best practices for secret management security. 

## [UI Update] MCP Icons Now Use favicon.png

- All MCP/package icons in the marketplace grid, MCP package page, and MCP server list now use favicon.png for a consistent branded look.
- Replaced previous generic icons (code, package, status, etc.) with favicon.png in:
  - Marketplace cards (MCPExplorer)
  - MCP package page (MCPPackagePage)
  - MCP server list (MCPServersList)
- Also removed the star rating UI from the MCP package page. 

## [Git] Merge Conflict Resolved in SecretsManager.tsx
- Resolved a merge conflict in the button styles for the Copy and Close buttons in SecretsManager.tsx.
- Used explicit color classes for both buttons for clarity and consistency.
- Successfully rebased on main and pushed the changes to the remote repository. 

## [URGENT] OAuth Redirect Fix Required ⚠️

### **Production OAuth Redirect Issue** 🚨 **NEEDS GITHUB & SUPABASE CONFIG UPDATE**
- **Problem**: GitHub sign-in redirects to `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback` even in production.
- **Root Cause**: A misunderstanding of the OAuth flow has led to incorrect configuration in the GitHub OAuth App and Supabase.
- **Correct Flow**:
  1. User clicks login on `sigyl.dev`.
  2. The site redirects to GitHub for authentication.
  3. GitHub **must** redirect back to your **Supabase Auth Callback URL** (`https://zcudhsyvfrlfgqqhjrqv.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`).
  4. Supabase creates the user session, then redirects the user back to your site's `Site URL` (`https://sigyl.dev`).

### **Required Configuration Changes** 🔧

1.  **In your GitHub OAuth App settings:**
    *   The **Authorization callback URL** field MUST be set to your Supabase callback URL: `https://zcudhsyvfrlfgqqhjrqv.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
    *   It should NOT be `sigyl.dev/auth/callback`.

2.  **In your Supabase Project settings:**
    *   Under **Authentication -> URL Configuration**, the **Site URL** MUST be set to your production frontend URL: `https://sigyl.dev`.
    *   Under **Redirect URLs**, you should have patterns for both production and local development, e.g., `https://sigyl.dev/**` and `http://localhost:8080/**`.

- **Status**: 🔧 **PENDING PRODUCTION ENV VARIABLE CONFIGURATION** 

## [2024-06-28] Update: MCP Server Delete Button

- The MCP server delete button in the dashboard now uses `deploymentService.deletePackage` instead of `deleteDeployment`.
- This ensures that deleting a server removes both the record from the `mcp_packages` table and the corresponding Google Cloud service.
- A confirmation prompt now requires the user to type the server name to confirm deletion, reducing accidental deletions.
- The UI and code have been updated to reflect this change. 

## [2024-06-28] MCP Package Logo Upload
- Owners can now upload a logo image (PNG/JPG) for their MCP package/server from the edit page.
- The image is uploaded to Supabase Storage (bucket: mcp-logos) and the public URL is saved as logo_url.
- The logo preview updates immediately after upload.
- Editing the logo_url field directly is now disabled; logo is set by upload only. 

## [Deploy Button Update] PageHeader
- The Deploy button in the PageHeader now conditionally displays 'Log in' if the user is not logged in, and 'Deploy' if the user is authenticated.
- If the user is not logged in, clicking the button triggers the GitHub App login flow via signInWithGitHubApp.
- If the user is logged in, clicking the button navigates to the /deploy page as before.

# Supabase Profile Update Issue — Debugging Status

## **Summary**
- The goal is to update the `profiles` table in Supabase (set `github_app_installed: true` and other fields) after a user installs the GitHub App and returns to the site.
- The upsert is triggered from the frontend using the Supabase JS client, with the correct user ID and payload.

---

## **What Works**
- User logs in with Supabase Auth (GitHub) — session and user object are available.
- The callback logic runs after GitHub App install, and the upsert payload is constructed and logged.
- The correct UUID for the user is present in the `profiles` table.
- RLS is OFF on the `profiles` table.
- The upsert code is triggered and logs the payload and user object in the browser console.

---

## **What Doesn't Work**
- The `profiles` table is **not being updated** (no change to `github_app_installed` or other fields).
- The upsert result is either missing or empty — no error, no data, no status.
- No network request to the Supabase REST endpoint (`/rest/v1/profiles`) is visible in the browser network tab.
- No CORS or JS errors are shown in the browser console.

---

## **What Has Been Tried**
- Logging the full user object, upsert payload, and upsert result.
- Using both `.then()` and `await` for the upsert.
- Minimal upsert payload (just `id` and `github_app_installed`).
- Confirmed correct Supabase client initialization and environment variables.
- Confirmed correct table schema and presence of the user row.
- RLS is disabled.
- Manual upsert in browser console (pending result).

---

## **Next Debugging Steps**
1. **Check the browser network tab** for any request to `https://<project>.supabase.co/rest/v1/profiles` when the upsert runs.
2. **Try a manual upsert in the browser console** and observe the output:
   ```js
   supabase.from('profiles').upsert({ id: '<user-uuid>', github_app_installed: true }).then(console.log)
   ```
3. **Log the Supabase client initialization** to confirm the correct project URL and anon key are being used.
4. **Check for any silent errors** or promise rejections in the browser console.
5. **If no request is made:**
   - The client may not be initialized correctly, or the session may be missing/expired.
   - Try re-authenticating or re-initializing the client.
6. **If a request is made but fails (401/403):**
   - The session may be invalid or missing.
   - Ensure the user is authenticated and the JWT is present.

## **Open Questions**
- Is the Supabase client definitely initialized with the correct environment variables at runtime?
- Is the user session valid and present at the time of upsert?
- Is there any network activity at all when the upsert is triggered?

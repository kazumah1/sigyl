# ‚úÖ COMPLETE - SIGYL MCP Platform Development Plan

## üéØ Current Status: MVP Ready for Launch

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Core Platform Features
- **Registry API**: Full MCP package management with Supabase backend
- **Container Builder**: Google Cloud Run deployment with enhanced security
- **Web Frontend**: Complete UI with dashboard, marketplace, and deployment wizard
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub App with repository scanning and automated deployments
- **Security System**: 22+ security patterns with mcp-scan integration and LLM analysis
- **Documentation UI**: Restored Mintlify-style docs interface from commit 7dfcfaa9cbc1a5ae367d917916b10149c4ade4c9
- **MCP Versioning & Updates**: Complete update/redeploy system with version tracking

### ‚úÖ COMPLETE - MCP Versioning & Update System

**Current Implementation:**
- **Version Tracking**: MCP packages store version info from `mcp.yaml` files
- **Upsert Strategy**: New deployments use `onConflict: 'source_api_url'` to update existing packages
- **Redeploy Functionality**: Complete redeploy system that rebuilds and updates existing Cloud Run services
- **UI Integration**: Dashboard includes "Redeploy" button for each MCP server
- **Complete Deletion System**: Full MCP package deletion with confirmation modal and Cloud Run cleanup

**Update Process Flow:**
1. User clicks "Redeploy" button in dashboard (`MCPServersList.tsx`)
2. Frontend calls `deploymentService.redeployDeployment(id)` 
3. API endpoint `POST /api/v1/deployments/:id/redeploy` handles request
4. Backend calls `redeployRepo()` function with existing service name and package ID
5. System fetches latest code from GitHub repository
6. Rebuilds Docker image and updates existing Cloud Run service
7. Updates `mcp_packages` table with new version/metadata
8. Replaces all `mcp_tools` entries for the package
9. Returns success with deployment logs

**Deletion Process Flow:**
1. User clicks "Delete Service" button on MCP package page (owner only)
2. Confirmation modal requires typing exact package name for safety
3. Frontend calls `deploymentService.deletePackage(packageId, confirmName, apiKey)`
4. API endpoint `DELETE /api/v1/packages/:id` handles request with authentication
5. Backend verifies ownership and confirmation name
6. Deletes Google Cloud Run service for all active deployments
7. Cascading database deletion: tools ‚Üí deployments ‚Üí secrets ‚Üí ratings ‚Üí downloads ‚Üí package
8. Returns success and redirects user to dashboard

**Version Detection:**
- Versions come from `mcp.yaml` files in repositories (`version: "1.2.3"`)
- If no version specified, falls back to `null` (no automatic versioning)
- Version updates are reflected in the `mcp_packages.version` field
- Updated timestamp tracks when last redeploy occurred

**Technical Details:**
- **No New Service Creation**: Redeploys update existing Cloud Run services
- **Database Updates**: Uses `UPDATE` instead of `INSERT` for `mcp_packages`
- **Tool Replacement**: Completely replaces tool definitions (not merged)
- **Environment Preservation**: Maintains existing environment variables
- **Security Validation**: Full security scan runs on each redeploy
- **Safe Deletion**: Requires exact name confirmation and handles Cloud Run cleanup
- **Ownership Verification**: Only package owners can delete their own MCPs

**UI Features:**
- Dashboard shows all user's deployed MCP servers
- "Redeploy" button with loading state and progress feedback
- "Delete Service" button with confirmation modal (owner only)
- Confirmation requires typing exact package name for safety
- Success/error toasts with deployment logs
- Edit functionality for package metadata (name, description, etc.)
- Automatic redirect to dashboard after successful deletion

### ‚úÖ COMPLETE - MCP-Scan Security Integration Analysis

**Open Source Security Project Analysis:**
- **Project**: [mcp-scan](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan) by Invariant Labs
- **Purpose**: Security scanning tool for MCP connections with static and dynamic analysis
- **Features**: Prompt injection detection, tool poisoning prevention, cross-origin escalation detection
- **Technology Stack**: Python, FastAPI, Invariant Guardrails SDK, Pydantic models

**Core Capabilities Identified:**
1. **Static Scanning**: Analyzes MCP server configurations for malicious tool descriptions
2. **Dynamic Proxying**: Real-time monitoring and guardrailing of MCP traffic  
3. **Security Patterns**: Advanced detection using Invariant Guardrails AI-powered analysis
4. **Guardrail Policies**: YAML-based configuration for custom security rules

**‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Enhanced Security Implementation:**
- Added 7 new security patterns inspired by mcp-scan (total: 22+ patterns)
- Implemented LLM-based tool description analysis using OpenAI API
- Added tool description hashing for change detection (MD5 compatible with mcp-scan)
- Enhanced security validator with hybrid analysis (pattern + LLM)
- Comprehensive test suite validates all security features
- Security blocking prevents deployment of vulnerable MCP servers

**Security Enhancement Details:**
- **New Patterns**: Tool Poisoning, Prompt Injection, Hidden Instructions, Base64 Encoding
- **LLM Analysis**: Optional OpenAI integration for sophisticated threat detection
- **Change Detection**: MD5 hashing tracks tool description modifications
- **Deployment Blocking**: 9+ critical issues automatically block deployments
- **Attribution**: Proper credit to Invariant Labs and mcp-scan project

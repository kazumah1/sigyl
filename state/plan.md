- **üì¶ CLI & SDK Published**: Both packages successfully published to npm with proper licensing
- **üé® UI Polish**: Installation modal improvements with consistent styling and responsive layout
- **üîß GitHub App Flow Fix**: Fixed installation check caching issue preventing proper deploy flow

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Profiles API Fix for GitHub App Deploy Flow

**Problem Identified:**
- Frontend was getting 500 errors when calling `/api/v1/profiles/me`
- Error: `PGRST116 - The result contains 0 rows`
- This was causing the GitHub App deploy flow to fail with infinite loading spinners
- Root cause: Profile lookup was using wrong user ID (API users table ID vs Supabase user ID)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Authentication was working correctly (Supabase JWT validation successful)
- Backend was trying to find profile using `req.user.user_id` (internal API users table ID)
- But profiles table uses Supabase user IDs as primary keys
- No profile record existed for the authenticated user

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Enhanced Profile Lookup**: Modified `GET /api/v1/profiles/me` to handle multiple ID types
- **Automatic Profile Creation**: Creates profile record if none exists using Supabase user ID
- **Fallback Logic**: First tries internal user ID, then Supabase user ID, then creates profile
- **Consistent ID Handling**: Updated PUT and DELETE endpoints to use same ID resolution logic

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extract Supabase user ID from `req.user.key_id` (format: `supabase_<user_id>`)
- Try finding profile by internal user ID first (backward compatibility)
- If not found, try Supabase user ID from key_id
- If still not found, create new profile using data from `api_users` table
- Apply same logic to PUT and DELETE endpoints for consistency

**Profile Creation Process:**
1. Extract user info from `api_users` table using internal user ID
2. Create profile record in `profiles` table using Supabase user ID
3. Copy relevant fields (email, name, github_id) from api_users to profiles
4. Return newly created profile to frontend

**Benefits Achieved:**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Deploy Flow**: GitHub App deployment wizard now loads repositories correctly
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Profile Creation**: New users get profiles created automatically
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing profiles continue to work
- ‚úÖ **Consistent API**: All profile endpoints use same ID resolution logic
- ‚úÖ **Error Resolution**: Eliminated 500 errors from profile API calls

**Flow Improvements:**
1. User completes GitHub OAuth ‚Üí profile API call succeeds
2. AuthContext installation check works properly
3. Deploy wizard loads GitHub repositories successfully
4. User can select repository and deploy MCP server
5. No more infinite loading spinners or 500 errors

**Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Deploy flow now works correctly for all users

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - GitHub App Installation Flow Fix

**Problem Identified:**
- New users completing GitHub OAuth flow were stuck on deploy page
- Installation check was using stale cached data from sessionStorage
- Cache persisted for 60 seconds, preventing detection of new installations
- Deploy wizard showed "Install GitHub App" even after successful installation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- AuthContext was caching installation check results for performance
- GitHub App callback processing didn't clear the installation cache
- New installations weren't reflected in frontend state immediately
- 304 status codes from browser cache masked the underlying caching issue

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Cache Invalidation**: Clear installation cache when GitHub App callback is detected
- **Forced Refresh**: Added `forceInstallationCheck` state to bypass cache after installation
- **Callback Detection**: Enhanced GitHub App callback handler to trigger fresh installation check
- **State Reset**: Clear installation-related state before forcing new check

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to detect GitHub App callbacks
- Added `forceInstallationCheck` counter to trigger cache bypass
- Clear sessionStorage cache when installation flow completes
- Reset `installationId`, `hasInstallation`, and `installationCheckError` states
- Trigger immediate fresh installation check after callback processing

**Flow Improvements:**
1. User completes GitHub OAuth ‚Üí redirected to deploy page
2. AuthContext detects callback parameters (`installationId` or `code`)
3. Clears installation cache and resets related state
4. Forces fresh installation check bypassing cache
5. Deploy wizard correctly detects new installation
6. User can proceed with repository selection and deployment

**Benefits Achieved:**
- ‚úÖ **Seamless Deploy Flow**: New users can deploy immediately after GitHub installation
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: Installation status reflects immediately without page refresh
- ‚úÖ **Cache Performance**: Maintains caching benefits for normal usage
- ‚úÖ **Robust Detection**: Handles edge cases with callback parameter detection
- ‚úÖ **User Experience**: Eliminates confusion about installation status

**Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Deploy flow now works correctly for new GitHub App installations

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - UI/UX Improvements (Latest)

**Installation Modal Enhancements:**
- **Button Consistency**: Fixed "Next" button styling to match white accent color theme (was blue, now white)
- **Responsive Layout**: Increased modal width from `max-w-lg` to `max-w-4xl` to prevent content overflow
- **Grid Improvements**: Updated installation method grid to use responsive `minmax(280px, 1fr)` columns
- **Content Padding**: Added proper padding to prevent text cutoff on right side
- **Cell Styling**: Removed fixed width constraints, allowing buttons to fill available space properly

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modal width: `max-w-lg` ‚Üí `max-w-4xl` for better content accommodation
- Grid layout: Fixed 240px columns ‚Üí Responsive `minmax(280px, 1fr)` columns
- Button styling: `bg-blue-600` ‚Üí `bg-white text-black hover:bg-gray-200` for consistency
- Container padding: Added `px-2` to step 2 content for proper spacing
- Cell dimensions: Removed fixed width, kept height constraints for button consistency

**User Experience Benefits:**
- Consistent white accent color across all primary action buttons
- No more content cutoff or horizontal scrolling in installation modal
- Better responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Improved visual hierarchy and button accessibility
- Professional, cohesive design language throughout the application

### ‚úÖ COMPLETE - MCP Versioning & Update System

**Current Implementation:**
- **Version Tracking**: MCP packages store version info from `mcp.yaml` files
- **Upsert Strategy**: New deployments use `onConflict: 'source_api_url'` to update existing packages
- **Redeploy Functionality**: Complete redeploy system that rebuilds and updates existing Cloud Run services
- **UI Integration**: Dashboard includes "Redeploy" button for each MCP server
- **Complete Deletion System**: Full MCP package deletion with confirmation modal and Cloud Run cleanup

**Update Process Flow:**
1. User clicks "Redeploy" button in dashboard (`MCPServersList.tsx`)
2. Frontend calls `deploymentService.redeployDeployment(id)` 
3. API endpoint `POST /api/v1/deployments/:id/redeploy` handles request
4. Backend calls `redeployRepo()` function with existing service name and package ID
5. System fetches latest code from GitHub repository
6. Rebuilds Docker image and updates existing Cloud Run service
7. Updates `mcp_packages` table with new version/metadata
8. Replaces all `mcp_tools` entries for the package
9. Returns success with deployment logs

**Deletion Process Flow:**
1. User clicks "Delete Service" button on MCP package page (owner only)
2. Confirmation modal requires typing exact package name for safety
3. Frontend calls `deploymentService.deletePackage(packageId, confirmName, apiKey)`
4. API endpoint `DELETE /api/v1/packages/:id` handles request with authentication
5. Backend verifies ownership and confirmation name
6. Deletes Google Cloud Run service for all active deployments
7. Cascading database deletion: tools ‚Üí deployments ‚Üí secrets ‚Üí ratings ‚Üí downloads ‚Üí package
8. Returns success and redirects user to dashboard

**Version Detection:**
- Versions come from `mcp.yaml` files in repositories (`version: "1.2.3"`)
- If no version specified, falls back to `null` (no automatic versioning)
- Version updates are reflected in the `mcp_packages.version` field
- Updated timestamp tracks when last redeploy occurred

**Technical Details:**
- **No New Service Creation**: Redeploys update existing Cloud Run services
- **Database Updates**: Uses `UPDATE` instead of `INSERT` for `mcp_packages`
- **Tool Replacement**: Completely replaces tool definitions (not merged)
- **Environment Preservation**: Maintains existing environment variables
- **Security Validation**: Full security scan runs on each redeploy
- **Safe Deletion**: Requires exact name confirmation and handles Cloud Run cleanup
- **Ownership Verification**: Only package owners can delete their own MCPs

**UI Features:**
- Dashboard shows all user's deployed MCP servers
- "Redeploy" button with loading state and progress feedback
- "Delete Service" button with confirmation modal (owner only)
- Confirmation requires typing exact package name for safety
- Success/error toasts with deployment logs

### ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Technical Issue Resolution Post-Migration

# Project Plan Update

## Docs API Endpoint
- Added `/api/v1/docs` route to the registry API.
- Supports listing available docs and fetching individual docs by name (without extension).
- Serves `.mdx` files from `packages/registry-api/docs` as raw markdown (Content-Type: text/markdown).
- Returns 404 for missing docs, 400 for invalid names.
- No authentication required.

## MCP Tool for Docs
- Added `getDocContent` tool to the MCP server.
- Takes a `docName` (string, no extension), fetches the doc from the registry API, and returns the raw markdown.
- Handles errors and returns error messages as text.
- Uses `node-fetch` for HTTP requests.
- Registry API URL is configurable via `REGISTRY_API_URL` env var, defaults to localhost:3000.

## .mdx Support
- Docs files can be `.mdx` (markdown with JSX), but are returned as raw markdown (not rendered HTML).
- This is compatible with LLM and downstream consumers that expect markdown.

# ‚úÖ COMPLETE - SIGYL MCP Platform Development Plan

## üéØ Current Status: MVP Ready for Launch

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Core Platform Features
- **Registry API**: Full MCP package management with Supabase backend
- **Container Builder**: Google Cloud Run deployment with enhanced security
- **Web Frontend**: Complete UI with dashboard, marketplace, and deployment wizard
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub App with repository scanning and automated deployments
- **Security System**: 22+ security patterns with mcp-scan integration and LLM analysis
- **Documentation UI**: Restored Mintlify-style docs interface from commit 7dfcfaa9cbc1a5ae367d917916b10149c4ade4c9

### ‚úÖ COMPLETE - MCP-Scan Security Integration Analysis

**Open Source Security Project Analysis:**
- **Project**: [mcp-scan](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan) by Invariant Labs
- **Purpose**: Security scanning tool for MCP connections with static and dynamic analysis
- **Features**: Prompt injection detection, tool poisoning prevention, cross-origin escalation detection
- **Technology Stack**: Python, FastAPI, Invariant Guardrails SDK, Pydantic models

**Core Capabilities Identified:**
1. **Static Scanning**: Analyzes MCP server configurations for malicious tool descriptions
2. **Dynamic Proxying**: Real-time monitoring and guardrailing of MCP traffic  
3. **Security Patterns**: Advanced detection using Invariant Guardrails AI-powered analysis
4. **Guardrail Policies**: YAML-based configuration for custom security rules

**‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Enhanced Security Implementation:**
- Added 7 new security patterns inspired by mcp-scan (total: 22+ patterns)
- Implemented LLM-based tool description analysis using OpenAI API
- Added tool description hashing for change detection (MD5 compatible with mcp-scan)
- Enhanced security validator with hybrid analysis (pattern + LLM)
- Comprehensive test suite validates all security features
- Security blocking prevents deployment of vulnerable MCP servers

**Security Enhancement Details:**
- **New Patterns**: Tool Poisoning, Prompt Injection, Hidden Instructions, Base64 Encoding
- **LLM Analysis**: Optional OpenAI integration for sophisticated threat detection
- **Change Detection**: MD5 hashing tracks tool description modifications
- **Deployment Blocking**: 9+ critical issues automatically block deployments
- **Attribution**: Proper credit to Invariant Labs and mcp-scan project

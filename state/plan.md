# MCP CLI Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a CLI tool that scans Express/Node.js applications and automatically generates Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers from their endpoints.

**Core Value Proposition**: Convert existing Express APIs into MCP tools with zero manual configuration, enabling AI assistants to directly interact with web services.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

### Key Components

1. **Express Scanner** (`lib/express-scanner.ts`)
   - Uses ts-morph for AST parsing of Express applications
   - Detects route definitions and extracts metadata
   - Supports multiple Express patterns (app.get, router.use, etc.)
   - **Enhanced**: Extracts TypeScript types and interfaces
   - **Enhanced**: Analyzes request handler functions for parameter usage
   - **Enhanced**: Maps Express patterns (req.body, req.params, req.query) to proper types

2. **MCP Generator** (`lib/mcp-generator.ts`)
   - Converts Express endpoints to MCP tool definitions
   - Generates TypeScript MCP servers with SDK integration
   - Creates individual tool handlers for each endpoint
   - **Enhanced**: Maps TypeScript types to JSON Schema types
   - **Enhanced**: Generates proper TypeScript interfaces for tool arguments
   - **Enhanced**: Handles request body properties and validation

3. **CLI Commands**
   - `scan`: One-time generation of MCP server from Express app
   - `dev`: Development mode with hot reload and MCP Inspector
   - `build`: Production build of generated MCP server

## Development Approach

**Strategy**: Borrow proven patterns from Smithery's open-source CLI rather than building from scratch.

**Key Borrowed Components**:
- CLI architecture using commander.js
- Development server with subprocess management  
- Build system integration with esbuild
- Hot reload functionality
- Configuration management patterns

**Estimated Time Savings**: 10-15 days by reusing battle-tested infrastructure.

## Technical Decisions

### Language Choice
- **TypeScript**: Primary implementation language
- **Rationale**: Best tooling for Express AST parsing, strong typing for MCP SDK integration

### AST Parsing
- **Tool**: ts-morph (TypeScript compiler wrapper)
- **Rationale**: More maintainable than regex parsing, handles complex Express patterns

### MCP Integration
- **Approach**: Generate servers using official MCP SDK
- **Rationale**: Ensures compatibility and leverages official tools

### Development Experience
- **Pattern**: Borrow from successful CLI tools (Smithery)
- **Focus**: Developer ergonomics and fast iteration cycles

### Type Extraction Strategy
- **Approach**: Two-pass scanning (types first, then routes)
- **Rationale**: Enables proper type resolution and mapping
- **Current Status**: Basic type extraction working, advanced property analysis pending

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: Successfully convert 90%+ of common Express patterns
2. **Performance**: Sub-5 second generation for typical Express apps  
3. **Developer Experience**: Single command to go from Express app to working MCP server
4. **Reliability**: Generated servers work correctly with MCP Inspector and Claude
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript type extraction and JSON Schema mapping

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complex Express Patterns**: Focus on 80/20 rule - handle most common patterns first
2. **MCP Compatibility**: Use official SDK and test with multiple MCP clients
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Automated testing for generated code quality
4. **Performance**: Implement caching and incremental builds for large applications
5. **Type Complexity**: Start with basic types, gradually add advanced type analysis

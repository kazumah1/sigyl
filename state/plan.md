# Sigil MCP Registry & Hosting MVP Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Startup:** Sigil  
**Goal:** Build an end-to-end functional MVP for MCP Registry & Hosting

### Core Components:
- MCP Registry API (Express + PostgreSQL)
- Docker-based MCP deploys (hosted via Railway)
- CLI tool (mcp publish) that auto-generates, deploys, and registers
- Minimal web frontend (React + Vite) for discovery

## 📦 Tech Stack
| Component | Stack | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Registry DB | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| API Layer | Express (TypeScript) | ✅ **COMPLETE & OPERATIONAL** |
| CLI | oclif (TypeScript) | 🟡 **MOSTLY COMPLETE** (missing deploy) |
| Container Hosting | Docker + Railway | 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** (partner working on it) |
| Frontend | React + Tailwind (Vite) | ✅ **GITHUB INTEGRATION COMPLETE** |

## ✅ Current Status

### STEP 1: DB Schema (Supabase) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ PostgreSQL schema deployed to Supabase
- ✅ Tables: `mcp_packages`, `mcp_deployments`, `mcp_tools`
- ✅ Proper relationships and constraints in place

### STEP 2: Registry API (Express) - **COMPLETE & OPERATIONAL** ✅
**Successfully implemented, tested, and running in development**

**What's working:**
- ✅ Express server with TypeScript
- ✅ Supabase database integration and connection verified
- ✅ Full CRUD API endpoints operational:
  - `POST /api/v1/packages` → Create new packages
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/search` → Search with filters
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/:name` → Get package details
  - `GET /api/v1/packages` → List all packages
- ✅ Health check endpoint (`/health`) - tested with Postman
- ✅ Input validation with Zod
- ✅ Error handling and consistent API responses
- ✅ CORS and security middleware
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ **API tested and confirmed working via Postman**

**Development environment:**
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Database connection established
- ✅ Server running on port 3000
- ✅ Ready for integration with other components

### STEP 3: Container Builder - **IN PROGRESS** 🚧
- 🚧 Partner dev is working on this in parallel
- 📋 Docker containerization for MCP servers
- 📋 Integration with Railway deployment

### STEP 4: CLI Tool - **MOSTLY COMPLETE** 🟡
- ✅ CLI structure and commands implemented
- ❌ **Missing: Deploy command** (needs Container Builder integration)
- 🎯 **Ready to integrate with Registry API once Container Builder is ready**

### STEP 5: Web Frontend - **GITHUB INTEGRATION COMPLETE** ✅
**Status:** Hours 2-4 GitHub OAuth + Repository Selector COMPLETE

**✅ Already Implemented:**
- ✅ React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind setup
- ✅ GitHub OAuth integration with proper scopes (`read:user user:email repo`)
- ✅ Authentication context and protected routes
- ✅ Beautiful dark theme UI with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Deploy page structure with template selection
- ✅ User profile management

**✅ GitHub Integration Completed (Hours 2-4):**
- ✅ GitHub repository fetching service with enhanced private repo support
- ✅ Repository selector UI component with collapsible behavior
- ✅ Integration with authenticated GitHub API
- ✅ Deploy wizard with repo selection flow
- ✅ Prominent "MCP Detected" badges on compatible repositories
- ✅ List collapse when repository is selected for better UX
- ✅ Full deployment service connecting to registry API
- ✅ **Fixed 403 Forbidden errors for private repositories**
- ✅ Smart MCP detection that works with both public and private repos
- ✅ Comprehensive path checking for mcp.yaml files in common locations
- ✅ **CORS integration working - successful registry API connection**

**🔧 Technical Improvements:**
- **GitHub API Enhancements**: Fixed issues with private repository access
  - Improved MCP detection that doesn't rely on search API for private repos
  - Added comprehensive path checking for common MCP file locations
  - Separate handling for public vs private repositories
  - Enhanced error handling for permission issues
- **Registry Integration**: Fixed CORS issues for cross-origin requests
  - Updated registry API to allow frontend origin (localhost:8080)
  - Successful deployment registration confirmed (201 Created responses)

**📋 What's Ready:**
- Can connect to operational Registry API
- User authentication working
- Frontend scaffold complete and running
- **GitHub OAuth + Repo Selector fully implemented with real deployment**
- **Private repository MCP detection working properly**
- **End-to-end deployment flow working with registry registration**

### STEP 6: Integration Testing - **PENDING**
- End-to-end flow testing

## 🚀 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

With Registry API fully operational and GitHub integration complete:

### Option 1: Real Hosting Integration (Hours 4-6)
- Replace simulated deployment with actual hosting platform
- Connect to Railway or other hosting provider APIs
- Add deployment monitoring and logs
- **Advantage:** Complete production-ready flow

### Option 2: Marketplace Enhancement (Alternative)
- Build marketplace browsing with Registry API
- Add package discovery and search
- User-generated content and ratings
- **Advantage:** Rich user experience for discovery

### Option 3: CLI Integration
- Complete CLI deploy command with Container Builder
- Test end-to-end CLI workflow
- **Advantage:** Developer-focused workflow complete

## 🔄 Updated Implementation Order

1. ✅ **Registry API** - COMPLETE & OPERATIONAL
2. ✅ **GitHub Integration** - COMPLETE (Hours 2-4)
3. 🎯 **Real Hosting Integration** - NEXT (Hours 4-6)
4. 🚧 **Container Builder** - IN PROGRESS (partner)
5. **CLI Deploy Command** - Ready to implement once Container Builder is ready
6. **Marketplace Frontend** - Can start with operational API
7. **API Gateway** - Production routing and scaling
8. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end validation

## 📋 Issues Resolved

### GitHub API Private Repository Access
**Issue:** 403 Forbidden errors when detecting MCP files in private repositories
**Root Cause:** GitHub Search API has stricter permissions for private repos
**Solution:** 
- Implemented comprehensive path checking without relying on search API
- Added support for common MCP file locations (`mcp.yaml`, `mcp.yml`, nested directories)
- Separate handling for public vs private repositories
- Enhanced error handling for permission issues

### Registry API CORS Integration
**Issue:** CORS policy blocking frontend requests to registry API
**Root Cause:** Registry API only allowed localhost:3001, frontend running on localhost:8080
**Solution:**
- Updated CORS configuration to allow multiple origins
- Added proper TypeScript filtering for undefined origins
- Confirmed successful deployment registration (201 Created responses)

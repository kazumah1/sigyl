# Sigyl MCP Platform - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Migrating from Railway to Google Cloud Run for 60-75% cost savings while maintaining all functionality. The platform enables users to deploy MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers with a simplified configuration approach.

## ✅ JUST COMPLETED - Dashboard Black Screen Fix (React Hooks Violation)

**CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED - Dashboard React Hooks Violation**
- **🚨 CRITICAL BUG**: Dashboard component was causing black screen due to React hooks order violation
- **ISSUE**: `useState` hooks were being called after early return statements (`checkingInstall` and `error` conditions)
- **IMPACT**: Dashboard page would crash with "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Hooks being called conditionally/after early returns violates React Rules of Hooks

**✅ RESOLUTION APPLIED:**
- **Fixed Hook Order**: Moved all `useState` hooks to top of component before any early returns
- **Proper Structure**: All hooks now called unconditionally in same order on every render
- **Preserved Logic**: Maintained all existing functionality while fixing hook order
- **Updated API URL**: Fixed GitHub installation check endpoint to use correct `/api/v1/` prefix

**Fixed Components:**
- ✅ **Dashboard.tsx**: All hooks moved to top, proper React component structure
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: Corrected GitHub App installation check URL
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Early returns now come after all hooks are declared
- ✅ **State Management**: Workspace settings and installation checking work properly

**🚀 RESULT**: Dashboard now loads correctly, no more black screen, all functionality restored

## Deep Link & Install Command Status (MCPPackagePage, CLI, Web UI)

### ✅ Completed
- **Cursor, VS Code, Claude Install Commands:**
  - Install modal generates copy-paste CLI commands for all supported clients.
  - Commands now include both `--key` and `--profile` for proper authentication and user context.
  - JSON config for MCP server is available in a pretty-printed, copyable modal for advanced/manual installs.
- **HTTP API Deep Link:**
  - HTTP API button generates a copyable HTTPS URL for the MCP server, including `api_key` and `profile` as query parameters, using the deployed server's `source_api_url`.
- **Cursor Deep Link:**
  - Cursor install button generates a deep link for Cursor app, using the MCP server's name and config.
- **Security Note:**
  - Current approach exposes API key in the install command for convenience. This is a temporary solution; future plans include OAuth-based login for improved security and UX.

### 🟡 In Progress / To-Do
- **OAuth Login Flow:**
  - Implement browser-based or CLI-based OAuth login to avoid exposing API keys in install commands.
  - Store tokens securely for seamless CLI usage (like Vercel/GitHub CLI).
- **Further UX Polish:**
  - Improve error handling and user guidance for deep link and install flows.
  - Add more contextual help and documentation in the install modal.
- **Mobile/Accessibility Polish:**
  - Ensure all install/deep link features are mobile-friendly and accessible.
- **Testing:**
  - Comprehensive testing of all deep link/install flows across supported clients and platforms.

## Key Changes from Smithery
1. **Configuration**: Using `sigyl.yaml` instead of `mcp.yaml`
2. **Runtime Types**: `node|container` instead of `typescript`  
3. **Tool Loading**: Lazy loading at runtime instead of YAML definitions
4. **Hosting**: Google Cloud Run instead of Railway

## Current Status: ✅ TYPESCRIPT CLI PRODUCTION-READY - CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

### ✅ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED - Container-Builder Compatibility Fixed

**🚨 MAJOR ISSUE DISCOVERED & FIXED:**
- **CRITICAL BUG**: CLI was generating mixed `sigyl.yaml` format that didn't match container-builder expectations
- **ISSUE**: Generated files mixed `NodeRuntimeConfig` properties (runtime: node, language) with `ContainerRuntimeConfig` properties (startCommand, configSchema)
- **IMPACT**: Generated MCP servers would not deploy correctly on the Sigyl platform
- **ROOT CAUSE**: `generateMCPConfig()` method in both `mcp-generator.ts` and `init.ts` generated incorrect hybrid format

**✅ RESOLUTION APPLIED:**
- **Fixed Format**: Now generates proper `NodeRuntimeConfig` format for container-builder compatibility:
  ```yaml
  runtime: node
  language: typescript  # or javascript
  entryPoint: server.ts  # or server.js
  build:
    command: npm run build  # or npm install for JS
    outputDir: .
  env:
    NODE_ENV: production
    PORT: ${PORT:-8080}
  ```
- **Removed Invalid Properties**: Eliminated `startCommand` and `configSchema` which belong only to `ContainerRuntimeConfig`
- **Updated Documentation**: Added proper header explaining Sigyl platform compatibility

### ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED - All Scenarios Verified

    - required_secrets and optional_secrets are extracted from sigyl.yaml and stored in the registry
    - Tool input schemas are auto-extracted from Zod and stored
- ✅ Fixed: IAM policy for Cloud Run services is now programmatically updated to allow unauthenticated invocations (allUsers as run.invoker)
    - Robust logging and verification ensure unauthenticated access is enabled after every deploy
    - No more manual UI steps required for public endpoints

### 🛠️ Outstanding/To-Do

- 🔧 Ensure all CLI-generated templates (including blank and scan modes) use HttpServerTransport for HTTP/Cloud Run compatibility.
- 🔧 Consider refactoring CLI to always use generator logic for all templates, avoiding static template drift.
- 🔧 Add more robust error handling and user feedback for missing or misconfigured sigyl.yaml in the deployment pipeline.
- 🔧 Continue to monitor for any edge cases in build/deploy flow, especially with custom user repos or non-standard project structures.
- [ ] Test SDK can connect to a running MCP server and list its tools
    - Previously, the test tried to use connect/getTools, but this was not compatible with the MCP server API
    - Now, the test directly calls the /tools/list endpoint on the MCP server using axios, as per the MCP spec, and prints the available tools

- Example usage and comments are provided in both the generated code and CLI output.

## Security Note: CLI API Key Exposure

Currently, the CLI install command auto-fills and exposes the user's API key in the copyable command for convenience and a seamless install experience. This is a temporary solution. In the future, OAuth-based authentication should be implemented to avoid exposing API keys and to improve both security and user experience, following industry best practices (see Vercel CLI, GitHub CLI, etc.).

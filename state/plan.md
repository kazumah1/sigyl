# Sigyl MCP Platform - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Migrating from Railway to Google Cloud Run for 60-75% cost savings while maintaining all functionality. The platform enables users to deploy MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers with a simplified configuration approach.

## Key Changes from Smithery
1. **Configuration**: Using `sigyl.yaml` instead of `mcp.yaml`
2. **Runtime Types**: `node|container` instead of `typescript`  
3. **Tool Loading**: Lazy loading at runtime instead of YAML definitions
4. **Hosting**: Google Cloud Run instead of Railway

## Current Status: üé® UI POLISH IN PROGRESS

### üö¶ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. üîß **HIGH**: Test mobile responsiveness across all key pages
2. ‚ú® **MEDIUM**: Add loading states to other components (MCPExplorer, Dashboard)
3. üîç **MEDIUM**: Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
4. üé® **LOW**: Advanced UI component enhancements

### üìã Phase 2 Roadmap (NEXT)

**Dashboard & Component Polish**
1. **DeploymentDashboard.tsx**: Add real-time status updates
2. **MCPExplorer.tsx**: Improve mobile package browsing
3. **UserProfile.tsx**: Polish account management UX
4. **Consistent Design System**: Standardize spacing, typography, colors

**Advanced UX Features**
1. **Live Deployment Logs**: Real-time log streaming
2. **Performance Metrics**: Usage and performance dashboards  
3. **Enhanced Animations**: Micro-interactions and smooth transitions
4. **Dark Mode Polish**: Ensure consistent theming

**Supabase Integration and IAM Automation**
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Deploy flow now fully connects Google Cloud Run deployments to Supabase tables
    - author_id is now always a valid UUID from the profiles table (GitHub ID is mapped automatically)
    - required_secrets and optional_secrets are extracted from sigyl.yaml and stored in the registry
    - Tool input schemas are auto-extracted from Zod and stored
- ‚úÖ Fixed: IAM policy for Cloud Run services is now programmatically updated to allow unauthenticated invocations (allUsers as run.invoker)
    - Robust logging and verification ensure unauthenticated access is enabled after every deploy
    - No more manual UI steps required for public endpoints

### üõ†Ô∏è Outstanding/To-Do

- üîß Ensure all CLI-generated templates (including blank and scan modes) use HttpServerTransport for HTTP/Cloud Run compatibility.
- üîß Consider refactoring CLI to always use generator logic for all templates, avoiding static template drift.
- üîß Add more robust error handling and user feedback for missing or misconfigured sigyl.yaml in the deployment pipeline.
- üîß Continue to monitor for any edge cases in build/deploy flow, especially with custom user repos or non-standard project structures.
- [ ] Test SDK can connect to a running MCP server and list its tools
    - Previously, the test tried to use connect/getTools, but this was not compatible with the MCP server API
    - Now, the test directly calls the /tools/list endpoint on the MCP server using axios, as per the MCP spec, and prints the available tools

### üéØ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ CSS compilation errors eliminated
- ‚úÖ Cloud Run deployments return proper service URLs
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness improved across key pages
- ‚úÖ GitHub integration UI matches dark theme perfectly
- ‚úÖ Sigyl.yaml detection working with proper repository categorization
- ‚úÖ Deployment UX significantly enhanced with progress modals
- üìä User feedback on improved mobile experience (pending)

The platform is now significantly more polished with a cohesive dark theme, excellent mobile responsiveness, and comprehensive sigyl.yaml detection!

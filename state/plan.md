# Sigil MCP Registry & Hosting MVP Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Startup:** Sigil  
**Goal:** Build an end-to-end functional MVP for MCP Registry & Hosting

### Core Components:
- MCP Registry API (Express + PostgreSQL)
- Docker-based MCP deploys (hosted via Railway)
- CLI tool (mcp publish) that auto-generates, deploys, and registers
- Minimal web frontend (React + Vite) for discovery

## 📦 Tech Stack
| Component | Stack | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Registry DB | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| API Layer | Express (TypeScript) | ✅ **COMPLETE & OPERATIONAL** |
| CLI | oclif (TypeScript) | 🟡 **MOSTLY COMPLETE** (missing deploy) |
| Container Hosting | Docker + Railway | 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** (partner working on it) |
| Frontend | React + Tailwind (Vite) | 📋 **PENDING** |

## ✅ Current Status

### STEP 1: DB Schema (Supabase) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ PostgreSQL schema deployed to Supabase
- ✅ Tables: `mcp_packages`, `mcp_deployments`, `mcp_tools`
- ✅ Proper relationships and constraints in place

### STEP 2: Registry API (Express) - **COMPLETE & OPERATIONAL** ✅
**Successfully implemented, tested, and running in development**

**What's working:**
- ✅ Express server with TypeScript
- ✅ Supabase database integration and connection verified
- ✅ Full CRUD API endpoints operational:
  - `POST /api/v1/packages` → Create new packages
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/search` → Search with filters
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/:name` → Get package details
  - `GET /api/v1/packages` → List all packages
- ✅ Health check endpoint (`/health`) - tested with Postman
- ✅ Input validation with Zod
- ✅ Error handling and consistent API responses
- ✅ CORS and security middleware
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ **API tested and confirmed working via Postman**

**Development environment:**
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Database connection established
- ✅ Server running on port 3000
- ✅ Ready for integration with other components

### STEP 3: Container Builder - **IN PROGRESS** 🚧
- 🚧 Partner dev is working on this in parallel
- 📋 Docker containerization for MCP servers
- 📋 Integration with Railway deployment

### STEP 4: CLI Tool - **MOSTLY COMPLETE** 🟡
- ✅ CLI structure and commands implemented
- ❌ **Missing: Deploy command** (needs Container Builder integration)
- 🎯 **Ready to integrate with Registry API once Container Builder is ready**

### STEP 5: Web Frontend - **NEXT STEP** 🎯
- React + Vite + Tailwind
- Search and discovery interface
- **Can connect to operational Registry API**

### STEP 6: Integration Testing - **PENDING**
- End-to-end flow testing

## 🚀 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

With Registry API fully operational, you have excellent options:

### Option 1: Wait for Container Builder (Recommended)
- Complete CLI deploy command once Container Builder is ready
- Test end-to-end flow: CLI → Container Builder → Registry API
- **Advantage:** Complete backend flow working

### Option 2: Build Web Frontend Now (Also Great)
- Build React frontend to consume the operational Registry API
- Can create, search, and display packages immediately
- **Advantage:** Full user experience even without deployment

### Option 3: Add Sample Data
- Use Postman/curl to add some sample MCP packages
- Test all API endpoints thoroughly
- **Advantage:** Rich data for frontend development

## 🔄 Updated Implementation Order

1. ✅ **Registry API** - COMPLETE & OPERATIONAL
2. 🚧 **Container Builder** - IN PROGRESS (partner)
3. **CLI Deploy Command** - Ready to implement once Container Builder is ready
4. **Web Frontend** - Can start now with operational API
5. **API Gateway** - Production routing and scaling
6. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end validation

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- [x] Database schema design and deployment
- [x] CLI tool core functionality (missing deploy only)
- [x] **Registry API core functionality** ← **COMPLETE & OPERATIONAL** ✅
- [ ] Docker container builder ← **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] CLI deploy command completion
- [ ] Web frontend ← **NEXT RECOMMENDED STEP**
- [ ] API gateway setup
- [ ] End-to-end integration

## 🧪 Registry API Status: OPERATIONAL

**Running at:** `http://localhost:3000`
**Health check:** `http://localhost:3000/health` ✅ **TESTED**
**API base:** `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/packages` ✅ **TESTED**

**Ready for:**
- CLI integration
- Web frontend development
- Container Builder integration
- Production deployment

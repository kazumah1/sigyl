## ✅ Current Status

### STEP 1: DB Schema (Supabase) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ PostgreSQL schema deployed to Supabase
- ✅ Tables: `mcp_packages`, `mcp_deployments`, `mcp_tools`
- ✅ Proper relationships and constraints in place

### STEP 2: Registry API (Express) - **COMPLETE & OPERATIONAL** ✅
**Successfully implemented, tested, and running in development**

**What's working:**
- ✅ Express server with TypeScript
- ✅ Supabase database integration and connection verified
- ✅ Full CRUD API endpoints operational:
  - `POST /api/v1/packages` → Create new packages
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/search` → Search with filters
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/:name` → Get package details
  - `GET /api/v1/packages` → List all packages
- ✅ **NEW: GitHub App API endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/github/installations/:id/repositories` → List repos with MCP status
  - `GET /api/v1/github/installations/:id/repositories/:owner/:repo/mcp` → Get MCP config
  - `GET /api/v1/github/installations/:id` → Get installation info
  - `POST /api/v1/github/installations/:id/deploy` → Deploy MCP from repo
- ✅ Health check endpoint (`/health`) - tested with Postman
- ✅ Input validation with Zod
- ✅ Error handling and consistent API responses
- ✅ CORS and security middleware configured for frontend integration
- ✅ **API tested and confirmed working via frontend integration**

### STEP 3: GitHub App Integration - **IMPLEMENTED** ✅
**Status:** GitHub App authentication flow implemented

**✅ Implemented Components:**
- ✅ **GitHubAppService**: JWT signing, installation token generation
- ✅ **InstallationService**: Database management for installations and repos
- ✅ **GitHub App Routes**: Complete API endpoints for app integration
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Tables for storing installation and repository data
- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: GitHub App credentials setup

**✅ GitHub App Features:**
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with GitHub App
- ✅ Installation token generation and management
- ✅ Repository listing with MCP file detection
- ✅ Secure access to private repositories
- ✅ Database storage of installation and repository metadata
- ✅ MCP configuration file retrieval

**🔧 Technical Implementation:**
- **Authentication Flow**: JWT signing with RSA private key
- **Installation Management**: Store and retrieve installation data
- **Repository Access**: List and access repositories with proper permissions
- **MCP Detection**: Check multiple common MCP file locations
- **Database Integration**: Supabase tables for persistence

### STEP 4: Container Builder - **IN PROGRESS** 🚧
- 🚧 Partner dev is working on this in parallel
- 📋 Docker containerization for MCP servers
- 📋 Integration with Railway deployment

### STEP 5: CLI Tool - **MOSTLY COMPLETE** 🟡
- ✅ CLI structure and commands implemented
- ❌ **Missing: Deploy command** (needs Container Builder integration)
- 🎯 **Ready to integrate with Registry API once Container Builder is ready**

### STEP 5: Web Frontend - **GITHUB INTEGRATION COMPLETE** ✅
**Status:** Hours 2-4 GitHub OAuth + Repository Selector COMPLETE

**✅ Core Infrastructure:**
- ✅ React 18 + TypeScript + Vite setup with modern tooling
- ✅ Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme system
- ✅ shadcn/ui component library integration
- ✅ React Router v6 navigation with protected routes
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and loading states

**✅ Authentication System (GitHub OAuth):**
- ✅ Supabase Auth integration with GitHub OAuth
- ✅ Comprehensive authentication context with session management
- ✅ Protected route system for deployment features
- ✅ User profile creation and management
- ✅ OAuth scopes: `read:user`, `user:email`, `repo`
- ✅ Automatic user profile creation in database
- ✅ Row Level Security for data protection

**✅ GitHub Integration:**
- ✅ Complete GitHub API integration for repository access
- ✅ Private repository support with proper permissions
- ✅ Automatic MCP detection in repositories (`mcp.yaml` scanning)
- ✅ Repository selector UI with collapsible behavior
- ✅ Branch selection and file content access
- ✅ **Fixed 403 Forbidden errors for private repositories**

**✅ Deployment System:**

6. **Marketplace Frontend** - Can start with operational API
7. **API Gateway** - Production routing and scaling
8. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end validation

## 📋 Issues Resolved

### GitHub API Private Repository Access
**Issue:** 403 Forbidden errors when detecting MCP files in private repositories
**Root Cause:** GitHub Search API has stricter permissions for private repos
**Solution:** 
- Implemented comprehensive path checking without relying on search API
- Added support for common MCP file locations (`mcp.yaml`, `mcp.yml`, nested directories)
- Separate handling for public vs private repositories
- Enhanced error handling for permission issues

### Registry API CORS Integration
**Issue:** CORS policy blocking frontend requests to registry API
**Root Cause:** Registry API only allowed localhost:3001, frontend running on localhost:8080
**Solution:**
- Updated CORS configuration to allow multiple origins
- Added proper TypeScript filtering for undefined origins
- Confirmed successful deployment registration (201 Created responses)

- **Web Frontend**: Complete UI with dashboard, marketplace, and deployment wizard
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub App with repository scanning and automated deployments
- **Security System**: 22+ security patterns with mcp-scan integration and LLM analysis
- **Documentation UI**: Restored Mintlify-style docs interface from commit 7dfcfaa9cbc1a5ae367d917916b10149c4ade4c9
- **MCP Versioning & Updates**: Complete update/redeploy system with version tracking

- **Contact Form**: Fixed API URL construction and email integration
- **üì¶ CLI & SDK Published**: Both packages successfully published to npm with proper licensing
- **üé® UI Polish**: Installation modal improvements with consistent styling and responsive layout

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - UI/UX Improvements (Latest)

**Installation Modal Enhancements:**
- **Button Consistency**: Fixed "Next" button styling to match white accent color theme (was blue, now white)
- **Responsive Layout**: Increased modal width from `max-w-lg` to `max-w-4xl` to prevent content overflow
- **Grid Improvements**: Updated installation method grid to use responsive `minmax(280px, 1fr)` columns
- **Content Padding**: Added proper padding to prevent text cutoff on right side
- **Cell Styling**: Removed fixed width constraints, allowing buttons to fill available space properly

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modal width: `max-w-lg` ‚Üí `max-w-4xl` for better content accommodation
- Grid layout: Fixed 240px columns ‚Üí Responsive `minmax(280px, 1fr)` columns
- Button styling: `bg-blue-600` ‚Üí `bg-white text-black hover:bg-gray-200` for consistency
- Container padding: Added `px-2` to step 2 content for proper spacing
- Cell dimensions: Removed fixed width, kept height constraints for button consistency

**User Experience Benefits:**
- Consistent white accent color across all primary action buttons
- No more content cutoff or horizontal scrolling in installation modal
- Better responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Improved visual hierarchy and button accessibility
- Professional, cohesive design language throughout the application

### ‚úÖ COMPLETE - MCP Versioning & Update System

**Current Implementation:**
- **Version Tracking**: MCP packages store version info from `mcp.yaml` files
- **Upsert Strategy**: New deployments use `onConflict: 'source_api_url'` to update existing packages
- **Redeploy Functionality**: Complete redeploy system that rebuilds and updates existing Cloud Run services
- **UI Integration**: Dashboard includes "Redeploy" button for each MCP server
- **Complete Deletion System**: Full MCP package deletion with confirmation modal and Cloud Run cleanup

**Update Process Flow:**
1. User clicks "Redeploy" button in dashboard (`MCPServersList.tsx`)
2. Frontend calls `deploymentService.redeployDeployment(id)` 
3. API endpoint `POST /api/v1/deployments/:id/redeploy` handles request
4. Backend calls `redeployRepo()` function with existing service name and package ID
5. System fetches latest code from GitHub repository
6. Rebuilds Docker image and updates existing Cloud Run service
7. Updates `mcp_packages` table with new version/metadata
8. Replaces all `mcp_tools` entries for the package
9. Returns success with deployment logs

**Deletion Process Flow:**
1. User clicks "Delete Service" button on MCP package page (owner only)
2. Confirmation modal requires typing exact package name for safety
3. Frontend calls `deploymentService.deletePackage(packageId, confirmName, apiKey)`
4. API endpoint `DELETE /api/v1/packages/:id` handles request with authentication
5. Backend verifies ownership and confirmation name
6. Deletes Google Cloud Run service for all active deployments
7. Cascading database deletion: tools ‚Üí deployments ‚Üí secrets ‚Üí ratings ‚Üí downloads ‚Üí package
8. Returns success and redirects user to dashboard

**Version Detection:**
- Versions come from `mcp.yaml` files in repositories (`version: "1.2.3"`)
- If no version specified, falls back to `null` (no automatic versioning)
- Version updates are reflected in the `mcp_packages.version` field
- Updated timestamp tracks when last redeploy occurred

**Technical Details:**
- **No New Service Creation**: Redeploys update existing Cloud Run services
- **Database Updates**: Uses `UPDATE` instead of `INSERT` for `mcp_packages`
- **Tool Replacement**: Completely replaces tool definitions (not merged)
- **Environment Preservation**: Maintains existing environment variables
- **Security Validation**: Full security scan runs on each redeploy
- **Safe Deletion**: Requires exact name confirmation and handles Cloud Run cleanup
- **Ownership Verification**: Only package owners can delete their own MCPs

**UI Features:**
- Dashboard shows all user's deployed MCP servers
- "Redeploy" button with loading state and progress feedback
- "Delete Service" button with confirmation modal (owner only)
- Confirmation requires typing exact package name for safety
- Success/error toasts with deployment logs
- Edit functionality for package metadata (name, description, etc.)
- Automatic redirect to dashboard after successful deletion
